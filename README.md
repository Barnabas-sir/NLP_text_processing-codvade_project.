Sentiment Text Classification (NLP)

This project classifies text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using NLP and machine learning.
Text is cleaned, tokenized, lemmatized, and transformed into numerical form with TF-IDF.
A Logistic Regression model is trained after handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Pandas.
Future Work: Use Word2Vec or BERT embeddings for deeper context understanding.
